PHP Test Dice Roller Purpose The purpose of this test is to evaluate the way you think about and solve problems using PHP. Submitted code must be functional and designed well. Comments are required and should be written using traditional doc block syntax (http://www.phpdoc.org/). The Project Create a dice roller that can be executed via shell command and echo out the response. Roller Requirements The shell command will accept one string argument. The string argument will be in the format {digit}d{digit} where the first digit represents the number of dice and the second digit represents the number of sides. So if the string argument was 1d6 I would expect a resulting random number 1-6. If the argument was 3d6, 3 six sided dice would be rolled with the result being a random number 3-18.Execute the code on the shell like so:bash: php roll 3d6bash: 18The code must be able to roll dice for any number of sides and any number of dice and echo the result directly to the screen. Your code must handle and sanitize bad user input gracefully.You will not be evaluated for code meant to handle finding the PHP binary across platforms. So donâ€™t write code for it. PHP Requirements Should be written using PHP 5.3.x object oriented syntax (no procedural code)Demonstrate use of method keywords (public, protected, private, final)Code should parse, be functional and run without errors of any kind in strict mode
