job_exercises
=============

I like puzzles and I like 'exams' administered by companies that are hiring. Within this repo are those that I have found and completed.

Sometimes I will include where I found these exercises.  

Othertimes, I won't and they will just be a directory and then an instruction sheet (hopefully in html) 

Did I apply to all of these?  Short answer is no.  I would show rejection letters with specifics to where I went wrong.  I hope perhaps others could see this.  Read the rules, devise a solution, but fall back to this as a reference. 

'exercises' in this repo:

 - A puzzle thats on the weebly jobs website.  Read comments in js file, but everything was done in the developer console
 - dice_roll - Rules and php file in that folder. Rules are in a html file that I had recieved.


More to come as I round 'em up and pull sensitive information. I'm sure someone would be mad to see a solution for a exercise they expect everyone to applythemselves to. (Not just google for solution)
