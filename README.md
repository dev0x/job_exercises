job_exercises
=============

I like puzzles and I like 'exams' administered by companies that are hiring. Within this repo are those that I have found and completed.

Sometimes I will include where I found these exercises.  

Othertimes, I won't and they will just be a directory and then an instruction sheet (hopefully in html) 

Did I apply to all of these?  Short answer is no.  I would show rejection letters with specifics to where I went wrong.  I hope perhaps others could see this.  Read the rules, devise a solution, but fall back to this as a reference.
